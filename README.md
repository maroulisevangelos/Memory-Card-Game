# Memory-Card-Game
This project is a variation of the classic memory card game implemented in Python. The game supports 2 or more players and uses a deck of 52 cards (spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs) with ranks 1-10 and face cards (J, Q, K). Players take turns flipping pairs of cards, earning points for matches based on predefined rules.
